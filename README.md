To create a markdown cell, click on the "+" button in the toolbar at the top of the Jupyter notebook interface and select "Markdown" from the dropdown list. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut "Esc" followed by the "M" key to switch the selected cell to a markdown cell.

Once you have created a markdown cell, you can enter the title of the notebook by using one or more "#" symbols followed by the title text. For example, to create a title "My Notebook", you can use the following markdown syntax:

```
# My Notebook
```

This will create a markdown heading with the text "My Notebook" in a larger font size. You can modify the number of "#" symbols to create different levels of headings with different font sizes.


To create a markdown cell, click on the "+" button in the toolbar at the top of the Jupyter notebook interface and select "Markdown" from the dropdown list. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut "Esc" followed by the "M" key to switch the selected cell to a markdown cell.

Once you have created a markdown cell, you can enter the introduction text using plain text or various markdown formatting options. For example, you can use the following markdown syntax to create an introduction:

```
## Introduction

This notebook is designed to explore and analyze a dataset of customer reviews for a fictional restaurant. The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into the restaurant's performance, identify areas for improvement, and inform business decisions.

In this notebook, we will start by loading the dataset and performing some basic data cleaning and preprocessing. Then, we will perform some exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize and summarize the data. Finally, we will build a machine learning model to predict the sentiment of the reviews based on their text.

Let's get started!
```

This will create a markdown heading with the text "Introduction" in a slightly smaller font size, followed by a paragraph explaining the purpose of the notebook and the topics to be covered. You can customize the markdown formatting and content to suit your specific needs.

Once you have created a markdown cell, you can enter the list of data science languages using markdown syntax. For example, you can use the following markdown syntax to create a bulleted list of popular data science languages:

```
## Data Science Languages

Here are some popular languages used in data science:

- Python
- R
- SQL
- Julia
- MATLAB
- Scala
- Java
- SAS
```

This will create a markdown heading with the text "Data Science Languages" in a slightly smaller font size, followed by a bulleted list of popular data science languages. You can customize the markdown formatting and content to suit your specific needs.

Once you have created a markdown cell, you can enter the list of data science libraries using markdown syntax. For example, you can use the following markdown syntax to create a bulleted list of popular data science libraries:

```
## Data Science Libraries

Here are some popular libraries used in data science:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

Once you have created a markdown cell, you can enter the table of Data Science tools using markdown syntax. For example, you can use the following markdown syntax to create a table of popular Data Science tools:

```
## Data Science Tools

| Tool             | Description                                |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Jupyter Notebook | Interactive notebooks for data exploration |
| RStudio          | Integrated development environment for R   |
| Apache Spark     | Distributed computing framework            |
| Apache Hadoop    | Distributed storage and processing system |
| Tableau          | Data visualization software                |
| Power BI         | Business analytics service by Microsoft    |
```

This will create a markdown heading with the text "Data Science Tools" in a slightly smaller font size, followed by a table with two columns: "Tool" and "Description". The table will have six rows, each listing a different Data Science tool along with a brief description of its purpose. You can customize the markdown formatting and content to suit your specific needs.

Once you have created a markdown cell, you can enter the introduction to arithmetic expression examples using markdown syntax. For example, you can use the following markdown syntax to create an introduction to arithmetic expression examples:

```
## Arithmetic Expression Examples

In this notebook, we will explore some examples of arithmetic expressions in Python. These expressions use mathematical operators such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to perform calculations on numeric values. We will also explore the use of parentheses and operator precedence to control the order of operations in complex expressions.
```

This will create a markdown heading with the text "Arithmetic Expression Examples" in a slightly smaller font size, followed by a brief introduction to the topic. You can customize the markdown formatting and content to suit your specific needs.


To create a code cell, click on the "+" button in the toolbar at the top of the Jupyter notebook interface and select "Code" from the dropdown list. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut "Esc" followed by the "Y" key to switch the selected cell to a code cell.

Once you have created a code cell, you can enter Python code to perform arithmetic operations. For example, you can use the following Python code to multiply two numbers and then add a third number to the result:

```python
x = 5
y = 10
z = 3

result = (x * y) + z

print(result)
```

This will create a code cell that defines the variables `x`, `y`, and `z`, multiplies `x` and `y` together, adds `z` to the result, and then prints the final result to the console. The output of this cell should be `53`, which is the result of `(5 * 10) + 3`.

You can customize the Python code to perform different arithmetic operations or use different values for the variables as needed.


To create a code cell, click on the "+" button in the toolbar at the top of the Jupyter notebook interface and select "Code" from the dropdown list. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut "Esc" followed by the "Y" key to switch the selected cell to a code cell.

Once you have created a code cell, you can enter Python code to perform the conversion. For example, you can use the following Python code to convert a number of minutes to hours:

```python
minutes = 90

hours = minutes / 60

print(hours)
```

This will create a code cell that defines the variable `minutes` and then calculates the equivalent number of hours by dividing `minutes` by 60. The result is then printed to the console. The output of this cell should be `1.5`, which is the number of hours equivalent to 90 minutes.

You can customize the Python code to perform the conversion for different numbers of minutes as needed.


# Objectives

In this notebook, we will cover the following objectives:

- Introduce data science languages
- List data science libraries
- Provide an overview of data science tools
- Demonstrate arithmetic expressions in Python
- Convert minutes to hours using Python
- And more!

By the end of this notebook, you should have a basic understanding of data science concepts and be able to perform basic calculations and conversions using Python.
